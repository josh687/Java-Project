# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
My project is to design a memory game that tracks progress overtime to help you improve your memory.
This application will be used by users who either want a fun game to play or people who want to
try and improve their memory while actively tracking their scores to see their progress and improvement. I chose this
project because I personally love doing memory games such as the human benchmark test, but there was no  in depth
statistics to see how I am doing. I intend to make a ui where you can play at least two simple memory games
such as a numeric number memory test and a sequence memory test/chimp test/, which saves and tracks user scores,
and will give stats on either game over time.<br>

### User Stories

- I would like have a way to login with a profile, and add multiple profiles for multiple people to track individual progress.
- I would Like to compare Different User profiles stats with eachother with in depth statistics.
- I would like to see a calender for my scores, so I can see how i Scored on a peticular day.
- *user story for adding item x to list y* <br>
I would like to add a list of games played and I would like to add games to a **favourites** list
- *user Story for Viewing list y* <br>
I would like to see a list of my previous games results for a given game.
- I would like to see my highscore for the game




"Phase 4: Task 2" 
- new highscore set at "number" for a new highscore
- added profile "profile name" for adding a profile
- removed profile "profile name" for removing a profile
- added score to profile
- saved profiles
- loaded profiles
- lost game
